# Security policy

## Supported versions

`imprint` follows semver. We patch security issues on the **latest minor
of the latest major** of every package. Older majors get fixes only if
the vulnerability is exploitable in production and the fix is
non-breaking.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue.** Use one of:

1. **Preferred:** GitHub's
   [private security advisory](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim/imprint/security/advisories/new).
2. Email **tamimbinhakim.work@gmail.com** with the subject
   `[imprint security]`.

Include:

- Affected package(s) and version(s)
- A minimal reproduction or proof-of-concept
- Impact assessment (data leak, RCE, supply-chain, etc.)
- A redacted sample PDF if the issue is in parsing / rendering

You'll get an acknowledgement within **72 hours** and a fix or status
update within **7 days** for confirmed issues.

## What we treat as security-relevant

- **Code execution from untrusted input.** Crafted SVG, font, or PDF
  asset that triggers RCE in the WASM modules or the JS runtime.
- **Path traversal.** In CLI / config loader / asset resolver.
- **Resource exhaustion.** Crafted SVG / font / PDF that causes
  unbounded memory / CPU.
- **PDF/UA / PDF/X conformance bypass.** Output that claims a
  conformance level but fails veraPDF.
- **Signature forgery.** Any path that produces a `@imprint/sign`
  signature that a downstream verifier accepts despite being malformed.
- **Supply-chain risks.** Lockfile, dependency, install scripts, WASM
  artifact tampering.
- **ESLint plugin rule bypasses** that disable safety checks.

Issues that are **not** security-relevant: missed glyphs, wrong
hyphenation, slow performance, font licensing — please use the regular
issue tracker.

## Coordinated disclosure

Once a fix lands, we publish a GitHub Security Advisory and credit the
reporter (unless they prefer to stay anonymous). CVEs are requested for
any vulnerability with CVSS ≥ 4.

## Provenance

Every published package on npm uses
[npm provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements)
via the GitHub Actions OIDC release flow. Verify with:

```bash
npm audit signatures
```

WASM artifacts are SHA-256 pinned in the lockfile and verified at build
time.

## Font licensing

`imprint` itself ships **no fonts**. We consume font files the user
provides. Make sure your fonts are licensed for embedding (`Embedding`
flag in OS/2 or PANOSE table). The `imprint validate` command surfaces
fonts whose embedding flag is restricted.
