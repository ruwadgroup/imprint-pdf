# Stability

This document defines what's covered by semantic versioning, what's explicitly
mutable, and what we promise about upgrades.

## Status

**Pre-1.0.** Until `@imprint-pdf/core` reaches `1.0.0`, breaking changes can
land in any minor release. Pin exact versions if your project can't tolerate
surprises.

`0.x.y` ranges:

- `0.x` minor bumps may break the public API. Read the changeset.
- `0.x.y` patch bumps are non-breaking — bug fixes, perf, doc edits.

Once 1.0.0 lands, semver applies strictly. Major bumps for breaking changes;
minor for additive features; patch for fixes.

## Public API

Anything exported from a package's main entry or a documented sub-path is part
of the public surface.

## Explicitly internal

Anything under `@imprint-pdf/core/internal` or `@imprint-pdf/<pkg>/internal` is
**not** part of the public surface, even pre-1.0. Workspace packages depend on
it; external code shouldn't.

If you reference these and they break, that's expected.

## Output format

The PDF byte stream produced by `@imprint-pdf/core` is **not** part of the
contract — we may swap pdf-lib for `imprint-pdf` (Rust → WASM) at the v1
boundary, and the byte-level layout will differ. The PDF will remain **valid**
and conform to the same standards (PDF 1.7 default, PDF 2.0 opt-in; PDF/X-4 and
PDF/UA-1 in `@imprint-pdf/print` and `@imprint-pdf/ua`), but byte-for-byte
stability is not guaranteed.

What is contractual:

- **PDF version** — declared in config, honored by the writer.
- **Page metrics** — A4, US Letter, custom — exact pt dimensions.
- **Font subsetting** — embedded subsets contain every glyph used.
- **Tagged PDF tree** — semantic role mapping is stable across patches (additive
  only).
- **AcroForm field names** — derived from JSX `name` props verbatim.

## WASM modules

The set of WASM modules and their loading patterns are part of the contract. We
commit to:

- The `standalone` build pattern (WASM exported as bytes, app instantiates)
  stays compatible across patch and minor bumps pre-1.0.
- WASM module size grows by no more than 25% within a minor bump without a
  changeset call-out.
- Custom `AssetResolver` implementations don't break across patches.

## Tailwind plugin

`@imprint-pdf/tailwind` is pinned to a Tailwind major version. Tailwind v4
support stays compatible across imprint minor releases. A Tailwind v5 adapter
ships as a separate subpath when v5 lands; the v4 build remains maintained for
at least 12 months after.

## Provider signatures

The `@imprint-pdf/print` ICC profile bundle is keyed by a profile signature
(typically the profile's `mlucDescription`). We commit to:

- Built-in profile signatures change only when their behavior changes (different
  rendering intent, updated FOGRA / GRACoL bundle).
- Cache invalidation when this happens is deliberate and called out in the
  changeset.

## What's allowed to break in any pre-1.0 release

- The `/internal` sub-path of any package.
- Naming and organisation of cookbook recipes (URLs may move).
- Default values of optional config fields (e.g. `concurrency` could rise from 8
  to 16).
- The exact CSS produced by `@imprint-pdf/tailwind` for a given class (Tailwind
  itself can change it).
- Performance characteristics — we may swap algorithms.

## What we won't break in a pre-1.0 release without an opt-in

- The `<Document>` / `<Page>` call signatures.
- HTML element aliases (`<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`…) and their semantic tagging.
- `renderToBuffer` / `renderToStream` / `renderToFile` signatures.
- Existing config field shapes (additive evolution only).

## Reporting

If something is unclear or you think we've broken a stable surface,
[open an issue](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim/imprint-pdf/issues/new).
Pre-1.0 we treat reasonable surface confusions as bugs to fix in docs.
